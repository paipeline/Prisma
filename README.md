### Automate the automation.

## Why Prisma?

Prisma takes automation to the next level by not just executing predefined workflows like n8n, coze, and make.ai, but by actually creating the tools needed for automation.

## How It Works

1. **One Query, Complete Automation**: Simply describe what you want to automate in natural language
3. **Tool Creation**: Dynamically generates and configures necessary tools for your workflow, no need to create them manually like in n8n.
4. **API Keys**: Ask for API keys and other credentials if needed, Prisma will handle the rest.
5. **Ready to Run**: Your automation is immediately ready to use - no manual setup required

For example:
```text
"Create a workflow that monitors my Gmail for invoices, extracts the amounts, and updates a Google Sheet"
```
Prisma will be executed automatically:
- Create email monitoring tools
- Set up invoice parsing capabilities
- Configure Google Sheets integration
- Build and deploy the complete workflow
- Save workflow as a template for future use
