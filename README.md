### Automate the automation.

## Why Prisma?

Prisma takes automation to the next level by not just executing predefined workflows like n8n, coze, and make.ai, but by actually creating the tools needed for automation.

## How It Works

1. **One Query, Complete Automation**: Simply describe what you want to automate in natural language
3. **Tool Creation**: Dynamically generates and configures necessary tools for your workflow, no need to create them manually like in n8n.
4. **API Keys**: Ask for API keys and other credentials if needed, Prisma will handle the rest.
5. **Ready to Run**: Your automation is immediately ready to use - no manual setup required
